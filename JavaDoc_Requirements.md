### **JavaDoc Requirements:**

1. **Documentation Comments (JavaDoc):**
    - Every public class and public or protected method should have JavaDoc comments. This provides a clear understanding of the purpose and usage of the code.
    - The first sentence of the JavaDoc should be a summary description, ending with a period.
    - For methods, the description should start with a 3rd person declarative verb, like "Calculates...", "Returns...", "Sets...", etc.
2. **Structure of JavaDoc:**
    - **Short Description:** Immediately follows the declaration, without a line break. It should be a concise summary of the method or class purpose.
    - **Detailed Description:** After the short description, a more comprehensive explanation can be provided. This should be separated by a paragraph break (an empty line).
    - **Tags:** Use tags like **`@param`**, **`@return`**, **`@throws`**, etc., to describe parameters, return values, and exceptions, respectively.
    - **Paragraph Breaks:** Leave a line blank between separate blocks of text to create a paragraph break. This enhances readability by providing clear separation between different ideas or topics.
    - **Lines before Documentation Blocks:** Include a line break before each documentation block to clearly separate it from the preceding code or comments. This makes it easier to identify the start of each new block.
    - **Variable Documentation:** All class and instance variables should be documented with a comment explaining what the variable is for and how it is used. For instance, `private int counter; // counts the number of times the method is called`. This helps other developers understand the purpose of each variable in the code.
    - **Start of Text:** The first character of each JavaDoc comment should start right after a single space following the comment delimiter (/** or *).
    - **Space Between Comment Marker and Text:** There should be a single space between the comment marker (/** or *) and the start of the comment text. This ensures that the text is clearly separated from the comment markers, enhancing its readability.
    - **Tags used in the JavaDoc header:**
        - `@author`: Specifies the author of the class, interface, or method. This tag can be used multiple times if there are multiple authors.
        - `@version`: Provides the version of the class, interface, or method. This tag should only be used once in a JavaDoc comment and is generally followed by a version number or date.
        - `@since`: Indicates the software version when the class, interface, or method was first added. This tag is useful for tracking the evolution of a software system.

      These tags are placed at the start of a JavaDoc comment, before the detailed description and other tags like `@param`, `@return`, and `@throws`. Remember to include a space between the tag and the following information to ensure readability.

3. **Consistency:** The style and structure of JavaDoc comments should be consistent throughout the codebase.

### **Java Code Formatting Standards:**

1. **Indentation and Whitespace:**
    - Use consistent indentation (commonly 4 spaces) for blocks of code.
    - Proper use of whitespace improves readability. For instance, spaces around operators (e.g., **`a + b`**, not **`a+b`**) and after commas in lists.
2. **Brace Style:**
    - Consistent use of brace style (e.g., K&R, Allman). Java typically uses the "end-of-line" style, where opening braces are at the end of the line.
3. **Naming Conventions:**
    - Use camelCase for variables and methods.
    - Use PascalCase for class names.
    - Constant variables should be in all uppercase with underscores (e.g., **`MAX_SIZE`**).
4. **Line Length and Wrapping:**
    - Keep line length to a standard maximum (maximum of 80 characters) for better readability.
    - Proper line wrapping for long statements (e.g., long method signatures, for-loops, if-else conditions).
5. **Commenting and Documentation:**
    - Use inline comments sparingly and only when they add significant value.
    - Avoid redundant comments; code should be self-explanatory where possible.
6. **Organization:**
    - Group related methods and fields together.
    - Sequence methods logically (e.g., getters/setters, lifecycle methods in the order of their call).
7. **Error Handling:**
    - Consistent and thoughtful error handling, avoiding generic catch blocks.

### **Conclusion:**

Adhering to these JavaDoc and formatting standards is crucial for the maintainability, readability, and overall quality of Java code. Consistency across the codebase makes it easier for developers to understand and modify the code, especially in team environments. Regular code reviews and adherence to a defined coding standard are good practices to ensure these standards are met.
